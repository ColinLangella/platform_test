# This schedule creates a node, confirms that it's replicating, and then breaks it down again.
# 
# Please document your tests as you add them to the schedule; note that the tests in each section should build what they
# need, and completely clean up after themselves!
# 
#
# Examples and setup tests

# The first script (020) creates the pgedge directory; call this script after each cleanup script:
